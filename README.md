# Single Player Build System (spbuild)
> The build system for singleplayer devs

**WARNING: PROJECT IS NOT READY FOR USE YET. Please note that some of these options don't work yet**

## About
The goal of this project is to help little teams and solo devs configuring a multiplatform dev environment in a [WORA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) fashion.
To use, you only need to run
```bash
spbuild build [OPTIONS]
```
Here are some available options:
- `-s`, `--solution-path`: Path to the project config file (If folder passed, defaults to spbuild.json)

## Compilation requirements
### Linux
The default compiler for linux is GCC so you will need to install cross-compilers if you want to compile for other platforms.
- For Windows targets, install `mingw-w64` (on Arch, `sudo yay -S mingw-w64`)
- MacOS targets are not supported yet on Linux

If you also want to target different architectures, you will need to install the appropriate cross-compilers.
- For ARM targets, install `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` (on Arch, `sudo yay -S aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`)
- For 32-bit targets, install `gcc-multilib`, `gcc-libc` and (on Arch, `sudo pacman -S lib32-gcc-libc lib32-glibc`)
- For RISC-V targets, install `riscv64-elf-gcc` (on Arch, `sudo yay -S riscv64-elf-gcc`)

## Naming
- Project : A single target for the compiler (executable, library, etc.)
  - Project's output directory : The directory where the compiled files of a single project are stored
  - Project source : The directory where the project's source code is located.. usually right next to spbuild.json
- Solution : A collection of projects (like Visual Studio solutions)
  - Solution root : The directory where spbuild.json is located
- Dependency : A project that another project depends on to compile
  - Local dependency : A dependency that is part of the same solution
  - External dependency : A dependency that is not part of the same solution (can be from the package manager)

### Project configuration file options
- `name` : Name of the project. Can be any string
- `version`: Version of the project. Can be any string
- `project_type`: Type of the project. Can be one of the following:
  - `Executable`: A standalone application
  - `StaticLib`: A static library that can be linked to other projects
  - `DynamicLib`: A dynamic library (like DLLs on Windows)
- `target_archs`: List of target architectures. Can be any of the following:
  - `X64`: 64-bit architecture
  - `x86`: 32-bit architecture
  - `ARM64`: ARM 64-bit architecture
  - `ARM`: ARM 32-bit architecture
- `target_platforms`: List of target platforms. Can be any of the following:
  - `windows`: Microsoft Windows
  - `linux`: Linux-based operating systems
  - `macos`: Apple's MacOS
- `path`: The path to the project folder (relative to the solution root)
- `dependencies`: List of other projects that this project depends on (by name). If a dependency is not found in
    the solution, spbuild will look for it in the package manager (not implemented yet)
  - Each dependency is an object with the following properties:
    - `name`: Name of the dependency project
    - `version`: Version of the dependency project
    - `optional`: If true, the build will continue even if the dependency is not found
- `additional_includes`: List of additional include directories (relative to the project path) that are NOT in any local dependency

## Road to 1.0
- 0.2: Simple GCC.. Set the groundwork 
  - 0.2.1: Fix strange documentation, add a bit more error handling <- Latest
- 0.3: Cross compilation support, target architectures, target platforms <- Dev branch
- 0.4: More compiler support (Clang, MSVC) <- First Prerelease
- 0.5: Incremental build support
- 0.6: Cleanup, refactor, documentation
- 0.7: Package manager and external dependencies
- 0.8: Testing, bug fixing...
- 0.9: Final Polish, prepare for release

- 1.0: Release!
